List of Indian dishes
This is a list of Indian dishes. Indian cuisine encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines native to India.
Given the range of diversity in soil type, climate and
occupations, these cuisines vary signiﬁcantly from each
other and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables
and fruits. The dishes are then served according to taste
in either mild, medium or hot. Indian food is also heavily inﬂuenced by religious and cultural choices and traditions. * This list is only a guide and needs to be expanded.

6.7.1

Foods imported from Portugal in the
16th century

• Tempura ̶so thoroughly adopted that its foreign
roots are unknown to most people, including many
Japanese. As such, it is considered washoku (和⾷,
native food).

has been heavily modiﬁed since its introduction to
Japan by use of batter and dashi-ﬂavored dip, and is
usually considered to be washoku.

by Japanese Navy chefs. One of the most popular food items in Japan today. Eaten with a spoon.
Curry is often eaten with pickled vegetables called

Street foods are consumed in many areas. Often sold by
street vendors and peddlers, street food is usually readyto-eat food or drink sold in a street or other public place,
such as a market or fair, by a hawker or vendor, often
from a portable stall.* [1]
Street food vending is found around the world, but has
variations within both regions and cultures.* [2] For example, Dorling Kindersley describes the street food of
Viet Nam as being “fresh and lighter than many of the
cuisines in the area”and “draw[ing] heavily on herbs,
chile peppers and lime,”while street food of Thailand
is “ﬁery”and “pungent with shrimp paste... and ﬁsh Nikuman in Japan
sauce”with New York City's signature street food being the hot dog, although the oﬀerings in New York also
range from “spicy Middle Eastern falafel or Jamaican cal street food tradition of "Plate Lunch" (rice, macaroni

eaten with coﬀee, also sold at kiosks.* [6] In coastal areas this mofo is made with coconut milk and is known
as mokary.* [7] Other sweet mofo include a deep-fried
doughnut called menakely* [8] and a fried dough ball
called mofo baolina,* [9] as well as a variety of fruit fritters, with pineapple and bananas among the most common fruits used.* [10] Savory mofo include ramanonaka,
a mofo gasy salted and fried in lard,* [11] and a fritter ﬂavored with chopped greens, onions, tomatoes, and chilies
called mofo sakay, “spicy bread.”* [12]

In the Netherlands, street foods are usually sold by a small
store which is a mix of a cafe/bar and a fast-food restaurant, known as a snackbar or cafetaria. These stores may
also contain the typically Dutch vending machine, an automatiek. While patat friet forms the main portion of
the foods sold, many other items are also on oﬀer including diﬀerent types of deep-fried snack meats such
as kroketten and frikandellen, and cheese snacks such as
the kaassouﬄe (cheese deep fried inside a crispy bread
crumb crust). Often, the product range includes other
foods such as hamburgers, ice cream, bread rolls with different ﬁllings, and occasionally pizza, falafel, doner kebab
and shoarma. Also sold may be deep-fried Vietnamese

The most notable Italian street food is pizza, sold in takeaways and bakeries. Take-away pizza (or pizza al taglio)
is quite diﬀerent from pizzeria pizza. Unlike the round
pizza normally found in restaurants, which originated in
Naples as a street food itself, it is generally baked on large
square trays, and square or rectangular portions are sold.
It usually has quite a thick base, again unlike the traditional Italian restaurant pizza.
Toppings include margherita,
sausage, ham, and vegetables.

9.3.12 Malta
Pastizzi are small, ricotta cheese- or pea-paste- ﬁlled
puﬀ-pastry squares that can be bought from vendors in
practically every village in Malta. Ricotta pastizzi (pastizzi tal-irkotta) are diamond-shaped with a hole in the
middle where the ricotta stuﬃng can be seen, while pea
pastizzi (pastizzi tal-pizelli) are of the same shape but are
more like an envelope of puﬀ pastry with no holes.
The shops selling these pastries are called pastizzeriji.
They also sell items such as pies, pizza al taglio, sausage
rolls, baked rice, baked macaroni (timpana), and sometimes arancini.

Pani ca meusa served in a rotisserie in Palermo

Another local street food found in such pastizzerias is the
“qassatat”. This is a ball-shaped pie crust with an open
top, with the same two basic ﬁllings of ricotta or peas,
and sometimes a tuna and spinach mixture.

In Palermo, a street food would be Pani ca meusa (bread
rolls with sliced, cooked pork spleen), and "panelle",
deep-fried chickpea ﬂour batter. In central Italy porchetta
is common, which is a spicy roasted pork meat (from the
whole, boned animal), usually served in a panino (bread
roll).

Imqaret are deep fried pastries ﬁlled with a mashed date
mixture.

In Naples, fried food stalls,friggitorie, sell ﬁlled, deepfried pastries and other foods. A street food made of
oﬀal, commonly found in fairs and religious festivals in
Naples and in the whole of Campania, is the 'O pere e 'o
musso (“the paw and the muzzle”): calves' heads and
pigs' feet are boiled, sliced and chopped, then seasoned
with salt and lemon juice. This is also called musso re
puorco (“pork muzzle”), although only calf heads are
normally used.

Ħobż biż-żejt is usually bought from the inside of shops
rather than stalls. This is the local sandwich, made from a
local ﬂat-bun called a ftira or a rounder one called hbejza
which is ﬁlled with various ingredients available at the
counter displays. The basic Ħobż biż-żejt recipe consists
of ﬁlling the bread with oil and kunserva (tomato paste),
tuna ﬁsh, pickles, and other delicacies which vary from
shop to shop. These shops usually serve tea with milk in
small glasses to their regulars.

Hamburgers, hot dogs, and other such products being sold
from vans, replace perennial Maltese favorites such as

CHAPTER 9. LIST OF STREET FOODS

Spain

The concept of eating in the street is very rooted in the
Spanish culture, even though in the last few decades the
law has forbidden the sale of food in the streets due to
hygiene concerns. The most common way to eat is still
inside a bar with friends (tapeo), however, in winter, roast
chestnuts can be bought in the street, especially in the
north, and during ﬁestas, churros are also sold. Additionally, the typical bocadillo is the most common snack
all around Spain for school children and workers. Bocadillos can be ﬁlled with various foodstuﬀs typical of the
province (anchovies, sweet peppers, tortilla de patatas,
tuna, ham, meat, cheese, Empanada Gallega, etc.) and
are very convenient as “food on the go”. Some major
cities will have vendors selling ice cream, nuts and snacks
from kiosks.

9.3.20 Ukraine
Common Ukrainian street foods include various kinds of
stuﬀed dumplings, such as perohy, varenyky and pyrizhky
that are either boiled or fried and frequently served with
a sour cream dill sauce. Fillings include mushrooms,
onions, potatoes, ground meats and cabbage.* [24] Holubsti, cabbage rolls with rice or meat ﬁlling and a tomato
sauce are also frequently serves, particularly around the
holiday of Easter.* [24] Tartar inﬂuence can be found,
particularly in the Crimea region with meat kabobs being popular.* [24]

Kvass is a slightly fermented beverage made from rye
bread, yeast and water. Dried apples and plums are

Sweden

A very common street food in Sweden is hot dogs, and
the traditional korvkiosk (“sausage kiosk”) also often
serve meatballs with mashed potatoes, brown sauce and
lingonberry jam. Tunnbrödsrulle “ﬂatbread roll” is also
(
)
often sold as street food. It is a soft ﬂatbread normally
ﬁlled with a sausage and mashed potato and sometimes
with prawn sallad, lettuce and onion. Hamburgers and
kebab are also popular street food.

Converted or purpose built vans sell kebabs, baked
potato, hamburgers and chips, especially at night. Individual portable ovens capable of being wheeled by a
single man serve baked potatoes along with ﬁllings such
as cheese or chili con carne. On the coast fresh seafood
is often sold straight from the catch cooked in mobile
kitchens. At fairs, stalls sell candy ﬂoss and doughnuts.
In Lancashire, hot parched peas (black peas) are bought
from stalls, especially in the colder months. During winter there are stalls selling hot chestnuts. British street
foods include ﬁsh and chips which are frequently sold and
eaten out of a paper package.

The most common street food in the capital in earlier periods was jellied eels or pie and mash made from meat,
which would be covered in the liquor from cooking the
eels, although this tradition is no longer as common as in

Puerto Rico

Puerto Rico is well known for its street foods (referred to
collectively as cuchifritos in New York City) and is popular both in the Caribbean and in mainland North America.
Typical Bastreet foods include pinchos (a kebob of skewered pork, seafood or chicken, usually spicy and topped
with barbecue sauce on bread; often fried whole).
Empanadas are very popular. Fried ﬂour or yuca ﬂour
pastries stuﬀed with chicken, ground meat, potatoes,
corn, fruit, cheese, or seafood. There are also combinations such as cheese with meat, cheese with fruit, potatoes

There are also arepas stuﬀed with fried meat, seafood
salad or usually seafood cooked in coconut milk if one
likes.

In Trinidad and Tobago there are roti and shark & bake
stands that provide quick foods like roti, dhal puri, fried
bake, and the most popular, Doubles. Roti is a thin ﬂat
bread originating from India that is ﬂuﬀy on the inside and
crispy and ﬂaky on the outside. It is cooked on a ﬂat iron
plate called a tawah (Hindi tawa) or platain and served
with curried chicken, pork or beef. Dahl puri is similar
to the roti but is softer and pliable and has crushed dahl
lentils cooked with saﬀron and placed in the centre of
the dough before it is rolled out and cooked. This is also
served with either curried chicken, pork or beef.
Fried bake is made by frying ﬂattened balls of dough that
becomes ﬂuﬀy and increases in height as it is fried. It
can be served with fried ripe plantains, meat or gravy.
At the shark & bake stands fried bakes ﬁlled with wellseasoned shark ﬁllets and dressed with many diﬀerent
condiments including pepper, garlic and chadon beni can
also be found.
Doubles is made with two ﬂat breads called baras (from
Hindi bara, big” that are ﬁlled with channa (from Hindi

"chick peas") and topped with pepper, cucumber chutney,
mango chutney, coconut chutney or bandania/chadon
beni. It can be eaten either wrapped up as an easy to eat
sandwich, or open it up and eat each bara separately.

9.5.9 United States
In the United States, hot dogs and their many variations
(corn dogs, chili dogs) are perhaps the most common
street food, particularly in major metropolitan areas such
as New York City. Roasted nuts and gyros are often sold
in the cities. Cheesesteaks, breakfast sandwiches, and
pretzels are common in Philadelphia. Throughout the US,
ice cream is sold out of trucks. Tacos and Tortas are sold
from open food stalls. Pizza and egg rolls are available
from window counters.

Dishes based on plantains or green bananas are popular as
street food throughout Puerto Rico. Pasteles are a combination of mashed tubers, plantains, or bananas ﬁlled Some vendors operate out of food trucks and food carts,

they are regulated and subject to inspections by local

surged in popularity after the success of the Korean–
Mexican fusion truck Kogi Korean BBQ in Los Angeles in 2009.* [27]* [28] According to Smithsonian Magazine, the hip new generation of food trucks “are the

serving novel concoctions such as kimchi quesadillas, and
gourmet ice cream truck Coolhaus serving inventive ﬂavors such as Avocado Sriracha, Brown Butter Candied
Bacon, and Fried Chicken & Waﬄes.* [29]* [30]
Diversity and the lack of a strictly deﬁned national cuisine
means that, in most urban areas in the US and Canada,
vendors sell hot dogs, pizza, falafel, gyros, kebobs,
tortilla-based snacks such as tacos and burritos, panini,
crêpes, french fries, egg rolls, and other various dishes.

9.5.10

Virgin Islands

The most common street food in Australia is the sausage
sizzle, usually consisting of a thin sausage or sandwich
steak cooked on a barbecue and served on a slice of bread
with optional fried onions, cheese, mustard and tomato or
barbecue sauce. The stalls are usually run by local sporting or charity groups as fundraiser.
A pie ﬂoater is a meal served at pie carts in Adelaide and
elsewhere in South Australia. It was once more widely
available in other parts of Australia, but its popularity
waned. It consists of an Australian meat pie covered with
tomato sauce, sitting in a plate of green pea soup.
People can buy soft serve and other ice creams from vans
which drive around the streets. The vans alert potential
customers with a tinkling tune, for example Greensleeves
or The Entertainer.
In Melbourne and Sydney, kebabs and souvlakis have
taken over as the main street food due to the high percentage of Greek and Lebanese people in both cities, and
is popular as a late night snack, especially after a few
beers. They are known to curb late night drunken violence as punters gather around and enjoy a meal together
and share stories of their night.

List of pastries

• List of hors d'oeuvre
• List of pies, tarts and ﬂans
• Lists of prepared foods
An assortment of cakes and pastries in a pâtisserie.

This is a list of pastries, which are small cakes or confections made using pastry ̶a stiﬀ dough enriched with fat.
Some dishes, such as pies, are made of a pastry casing that
covers or completely contains a ﬁlling of various sweet or
savory ingredients. There are ﬁve basic types of pastry
(a food that combines ﬂour and fat) - these are shortcrust
pastry, ﬁlo pastry, choux pastry, ﬂaky pastry and puﬀ pastry. Many pastries are prepared using shortening, a fat
food product that is solid at room temperature, the composition of which lends to creating crumbly, shortcruststyle pastries and pastry crusts.

19.3 References

Pastries were ﬁrst created by the ancient Egyptians. The
classical period of ancient Greece and Rome had pastries
made with almonds, ﬂour, honey and seeds. The introduction of sugar into European cookery resulted in a large
variety of new pastry recipes in France, Italy, Spain and
Switzerland. The greatest innovator was Marie-Antoine
Carême who perfected puﬀ pastry and developed elaborate designs of pâtisserie.* [1]

example, the cut rotelle is also called ruote in Italy and
“wagon wheels”in the United States. Manufacturers and
cooks often invent new shapes of pasta; or may invent
new names for old shapes for marketing reasons.
Italian pasta names often end with the masculine plural

-elle etc., all conveying the sense of“little"; or with -oni,

occur, too. In Italian, all pasta type names are plural.

List of Jewish cuisine dishes

Below is a list of dishes found in Jewish cuisine.

• Jewish cuisine

22.1 Traditional Ashkenazi dishes

• Kashrut, Jewish dietary laws

Ashkenazi Jews are the Jews descended from the medieval Jewish communities of the Rhineland in the west
of Germany. Ashkenazim or Ashkenazi Jews are literally referring to“German Jews.”Many Ashkenazi Jews
later migrated, largely eastward, forming communities in
non German-speaking areas, including Hungary, Poland,
Lithuania, Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Belarus, and elsewhere between the 10th and 19th centuries. As many of
these countries share similar dishes, and were occupied
by the Russian and Austro-Hungarian Empires until the
end of World War I, the place where the dish originated
is uncertain.

22.2 Sephardi and Mizrahi dishes
This section makes reference to the cuisine of the Jews
from the Mediterranean and the Middle East.
Sephardim are a subgroup of Jews originating in the
Iberian Peninsula (modern Spain and Portugal). Ladino
speaking Sephardim make the bulk of the Jewish communities originated in Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece, and
were also present in Morocco and Algeria.
Mizrahim is an umbrella term for the Judeo-Arabic and
Judeo-Persian speaking Jewish communities from the
Middle East and North Africa. It would also include several smaller congregations from elsewhere in Asia, such
as India, Pakistan and the Caucasus. In modern times,
they are also called Sephardi to contrast them to the European Ashkenazim culture and religious rites.
As in the case of Ashkenazi cuisine, the place of birth of
each recipe is generally uncertain.

List of Chinese bakery products
There are also regional diﬀerences in overseas cities with
large Chinese presences, particularly those in Asia like
Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Ipoh, Jakarta, Manila
and Bangkok. Bakery ﬁllings especially may be inﬂuenced by Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, or Thailand. In North America, the largest Chinatowns, such as
San Francisco, Vancouver, New York, and Toronto, have
the widest range of oﬀerings, including inﬂuences from
France, Italy, Japan, and Mexico.
Some bakeries also oﬀer small snacks traditionally associated with dim sum cuisine. There is considerable overlap between these categories.

25.2 Eastern-origin pastry

Chinese bakery products (Chinese: 中式糕點; pinyin:
zhōng shì gāo diǎn; literally: “Chinese style cakes and
snacks”or Chinese: 唐餅; pinyin: táng bǐng; literally:
“Tang-style baked goods”) consist of pastries, cakes,
snacks, and desserts of largely Chinese origin, though
some are derived from Western baked goods. Some
of the most common Chinese bakery products include
mooncakes, sun cakes, egg tarts, and wife cakes.
The Chinese bakeries that produce these products are
present in countries of Chinese ethnicity, and across the
world in Chinatowns. The establishments may also serve
tea, coﬀee, and other drinks.

25.1 Bakery types

Eastern-origin pastry section

Although there are large overlaps in the products sold at
Hong Kong style and Taiwan style baked goods, there
nevertheless remain signiﬁcant diﬀerences between these
two major types. For instance, bread cake and pineapple
tart were developed in Taiwan-style bakeries, while the
cocktail bun is a Hong Kong style product. Hong Kong
bakeries have more western inﬂuence due to the 150 years
of British rule that ended in 1997, and the nearby presence of the former Portuguese colony of Macau. Taiwan
style bakeries may have more inﬂuence from the Japanese
bakery or Korean bakery styles.

Some types of steamed or baked buns have a very similar
appearance, making it diﬃcult to determine what they
have been ﬁlled with. Informal de facto standards have
developed for indicating the ﬁlling by some external mark
on the buns, such as a colored dot or a sprinkling of a few
sesame seeds.
Unless otherwise indicated, most of the following foods
are baked. Some foods are steamed, boiled, deep-fried,
pan-fried, or do not require further cooking at all.

101

• Almond biscuit ̶Golden, delicate cookie with a

102

various types of ﬁllings

with a variety of ﬁllings

25.3 Western-inﬂuenced pastry

• Mantou ̶Plain, slightly sweet, steamed wheat ﬂour
yeast buns (unﬁlled); the traditional basis for Chinese steamed buns (baozi) with ﬁllings.
• Mooncake ̶Traditional variations are heavy lotus
seed paste ﬁlled pastry, sometimes with 1-2 egg

both the pastry crust and ﬁlling for more variety.

• Nuomici ̶Sweet glutinous rice dumpling with different ﬁllings such as sweet red bean paste, black

means a steamed bun.

List of Chinese soups

A bowl of meat-based geng

Beef noodle soup

This is a list of Chinese soups. Chinese cuisine includes
styles originating from the diverse regions of China, as
well as from Chinese people in other parts of the world.
Many Chinese soups are noodle-based. By 2000 BCE,
wheat had arrived in China from western Asia. These
grains were typically served as warm noodle soups instead
of baked into bread as in Europe. Chinese noodles are
used in the preparation of some Chinese soups.

This is a list of dairy products. A dairy product is food
produced from the milk of mammals. A production plant
for the processing of milk is called a dairy or a dairy factory. Dairy farming is a class of agricultural, or an animal
husbandry, enterprise, for long-term production of milk,
usually from dairy cows but also from goats, sheep and
camels, which may be either processed on-site or transported to a dairy factory for processing and eventual retail
sale.

This is a list of deep fried foods and dishes. Deep frying is a cooking method in which food is submerged in hot
fat e.g. oil. This is normally performed with a deep fryer
or chip pan; industrially, a pressure fryer or vacuum fryer
may be used. Deep frying is classiﬁed as a dry cooking
method because no water is used. Due to the high temperature involved and the high heat conduction of oil, it
cooks food extremely quickly.

from male calves (bull calves) of dairy cattle breeds.* [3]

cattle.

List of tapas
This is a list of common tapas dishes. Tapas are a wide
variety of appetizers, or snacks, in Spanish cuisine. They
may be cold (such as mixed olives and cheese) or warm
(such as chopitos, which are battered, fried baby squid).
In select bars in Spain, tapas have evolved into an entire,
and sometimes sophisticated, cuisine. In Spain, patrons
of tapas can order many diﬀerent tapas and combine them
to make a full meal. In some Central American countries,
such snacks are known as bocas.

List of hors d'oeuvre
• Dim sum
• Finger food
• Garnish
• Gujeolpan
• List of pastries
• Picada
• Short Eats
• Preprandial – a term sometimes used to refer to hors
d'oeuvre.
• Smörgåsbord

Some Hors d'oeuvre: Mozzarella cheese sprinkled with basilic
ﬂowers, black Greek olives, sun-dried tomatoes, Italian salami
and Spanish Lomo Ibérico.

This is a list of notable hors d'oeuvre, also referred to
as appetizers, which may be served either hot or cold.
They are food items served before the main courses of
a meal,* [1] and are also sometimes served at the dinner
table as a part of a meal. If there is an extended period
between when guests arrive and when the meal is eaten
(for example during a cocktail hour), these might also
serve the purpose of sustaining guests during the wait, in
the same way that apéritifs are served as a drink before
meals. Hors d'oeuvre are sometimes served with no meal
afterward. This is the case with many reception and
cocktail party events.

Chicken and dumplings
for added richness.
Since chicken meat would become dry and tough if it is
boiled long enough to cook the dumplings and thicken the
broth, the chicken or parts are removed from the broth
before adding the dumplings. While the dumplings are
cooking, the meat is separated from the bones. When the
dumplings are done and the broth seasoned and thickened, the chicken is returned to the broth. The dish is
then ready to be served, but may be kept on low heat so
as to not further cook the chicken.

Chicken and dumplings with vegetables

The name of the dish is sometimes printed on menus as
“chicken n dumplings”, “chicken 'n' dumplings”, or
“chicken-n-dumplings”. “Dumplings”is sometimes
spelled “dumplins”in this context.

Domesticated turkey
The domesticated turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) is a
large poultry bird, one of the two species in the genus
Meleagris and the same as the wild turkey. It was domesticated by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica at least
2,000 years ago, with the evidence pointing to what are
today the central regions of Mexico.* [1]
Turkey meat is a popular form of poultry, and turkeys are
raised throughout temperate parts of the world, partially
because industrialized farming has made it very cheap
for the amount of meat it produces. Female domesticated turkeys are referred to as hens and the chicks may
be called poults or turkeylings. In the United States, the
males are referred to as toms, while in Europe, males are
stags. The average lifespan for a domesticated turkey is
ten years.
The great majority of domesticated turkeys are bred to
have white feathers because their pin feathers are less
visible when the carcass is dressed, although brown or
bronze-feathered varieties are also raised. The ﬂeshy pro- Ceramic whistle in the shape of a turkey. Colima shaft tomb culture, 200 B.C. - A.D. 500

of an early misidentiﬁcation of the bird with an unrelated
species which was imported to Europe through the country of Turkey.

58.1 History
The modern domesticated turkey is descended from
one of six subspecies of wild turkey: Meleagris gallopavo, found in the area bounded by the present Mexican states of Jalisco, Guerrero, and Veracruz* [2] Ancient Mesoamericans domesticated this subspecies, using
its meat and eggs as major sources of protein and employing its feathers extensively for decorative purposes.
The Aztecs associated the turkey with their trickster god Black Spanish turkeys

Turkey production in the UK was centered in East Anglia, using two breeds, the Norfolk Black and the Norfolk Bronze (also known as Cambridge Bronze). These
would be driven as ﬂocks, after shoeing, down to markets
in London from the 17th century onwards - the breeds
having arrived in the early 16th century via Spain.* [11]
Intensive farming of turkeys from the late 1940s dramatically cut the price, making it more aﬀordable for the
working classes. With the availability of refrigeration,
whole turkeys could be shipped frozen to distant markets.
Later advances in disease control increased production
even more. Advances in shipping, changing consumer
preferences and the proliferation of commercial poultry
plants has made fresh turkey inexpensive as well as readily available.

ance of play. Commercial turkeys show a wide diversity of behaviours including 'comfort' behaviours such as
wing-ﬂapping, feather ruﬄing, leg stretching and dustbathing. Turkeys are highly social and become very distressed when isolated. Many of their behaviours are socially facilitated i.e. expression of a behaviour by one animal increases the tendency for this behaviour to be performed by others. Adults can recognise 'strangers' and
placing any alien turkey into an established group will
almost certainly result in that individual being attacked,
sometimes fatally. Turkeys are highly vocal, and 'social
tension' within the group can be monitored by the birdsʼ
vocalisations. A high-pitched trill indicates the birds are
becoming aggressive which can develop into intense sparring where opponents leap at each other with the large,
sharp talons, and try to peck or grasp the head of each
other. Aggression increases in frequency and severity as
the birds mature.

usually deep-litter, e.g. wood shavings, which relies upon
the controlled build-up of a microbial ﬂora requiring skilful management. Ambient temperatures for adult domestic turkeys are usually maintained between 18 and 21 °C.
High temperatures should be avoided because the high
metabolic rate of turkeys (up to 69 W/bird) makes them
susceptible to heat stress, exacerbated by high stocking
densities.* [13] Commercial turkeys are kept under a variety of lighting schedules, e.g. continuous light, long
photoperiods (23 h), or intermittent lighting, to encourage feeding and accelerate growth.* [14] Light intensity
is usually low (e.g. less than one lux) to reduce feather
pecking.
Rations generally include corn and soybean meal, with
added vitamins and minerals, and is adjusted for protein,
carbohydrate and fat based on the age and nutrient requirements. Hens are slaughtered at about 14–16 weeks
and toms at about 18–20 weeks of age when they can
weigh over 20 kg compared to a mature male wild turkey
which weighs approximately 10.8 kg.* [15]

Welfare concerns

reared turkeys and can begin at 1 day of age. This
behaviour is considered to be re-directed foraging behaviour, caused by providing poultry with an impoverished foraging environment. To reduce feather pecking, turkeys are often beak-trimmed, which has its own
ethical concerns. Ultraviolet-reﬂective markings appear
on young birds at the same time as feather pecking becomes targeted toward these areas, indicating a possible link.* [18] Commercially reared turkeys also perform
head-pecking, which becomes more frequent as they sexually mature. When this occurs in small enclosures or
environments with few opportunities to escape, the outcome is often fatal and rapid. Frequent monitoring is
therefore essential, particularly of males approaching maturity. Injuries to the head receive considerable attention
from other birds, and head-pecking often occurs after a
relatively minor injury has been received during a ﬁght or
when a lying bird has been trodden upon and scratched
by another. Individuals being re-introduced after separation are often immediately attacked again - it may be
impossible to re-introduce head-pecked individuals. Fatal head-pecking can occur even in small (10 birds), stable groups. Commercial turkeys are normally reared in
single-sex ﬂocks. If a male is inadvertently placed in a
female ﬂock, he may be aggressively victimised (hence
the term 'henpecked'). Females in male groups will be
repeatedly mated, during which it is highly likely she will
be injured from being trampled upon.

58.4.2 Breeding and companies
The dominant commercial breed is the Broad-breasted
Whites (similar to “White Holland”, but a separate
breed), which have been selected for size and amount
of meat. Mature toms are too large to achieve natural
fertilization without injuring the hens, so their semen is
collected, and hens are inseminated artiﬁcially. Several
Modern domesticated turkeys under commercial conditions
hens can be inseminated from each collection, so fewer
toms are needed. The eggs of some turkey breeds are

severely limited. For example, recommendations by the

adult birds each weighing 20 kg with 891 cm2 , despite
2
turkeys of this weight each requiring 1700 cm simply to
stand without touching another bird.* [17]
58.4.3 Waste products
The problems of small space allowance are exacerbated
by the major inﬂuence of social facilitation on the behaviour of turkeys. If turkeys are to feed, drink, dustbathe, etc., simultaneously, then to avoid causing frustration, resources and space must be available in large quantities.
Lighting manipulations used to optimise production can
compromise welfare. Long photoperiods combined with
low light intensity can result in blindness from buphthalmia (distortions of the eye morphology) or retinal detachment.
Feather pecking occurs frequently amongst commercially

Approximately two to four billion pounds of poultry
feathers are produced every year by the poultry industry. Most are ground into a protein source for ruminant
animal feed, which are able to digest the protein keratin of
which feathers are composed. Researchers at the United
States Department of Agriculture (USDA) have patented
a method of removing the stiﬀ quill from the ﬁbers which
make up the feather. As this is a potential supply of natural ﬁbers, research has been conducted at Philadelphia
University's School of Engineering and Textiles to determine textile applications for feather ﬁbers. Turkey
feather ﬁbers have been blended with nylon and spun into

240
yarn, and then used for knitting. The yarns were tested
for strength while the fabrics were evaluated as insulation materials. In the case of the yarns, as the percentage
of turkey feather ﬁbers increased, the strength decreased.
In fabric form, as the percentage of turkey feather ﬁbers
increased, the heat retention capability of the fabric increased.

Eggnog is traditionally consumed throughout Canada and
Eggnog, or egg nog ( pronunciation ), is a sweetened the United States around Thanksgiving and Christmas.
Eggnog may be added as a ﬂavoring to food or drinks
such as coﬀee and tea. Eggnog as a custard can also be
used as an ice cream base.

59.1 History

Eggnog with cinnamon

dairy-based beverage traditionally made with milk and/or
cream, sugar, and whipped eggs (which gives it a frothy
texture). Spirits such as brandy, rum or bourbon are often added. The ﬁnished serving is often garnished with a
sprinkling of ground cinnamon or nutmeg. Some recipes
call for the mixture to be heated to a safe temperature, to
protect from eggs possibly contaminated with salmonella;
egg-nog freshly made with contaminated eggs is not safe,
despite the presence of alcohol. Eggnog keeps well, and
is often considered to improve when aged for up to a year.
It was also known as the egg milk punch.* [1]* [2]

ply developed from posset, a medieval European beverage made with hot milk;* [3] eggs were added to some
posset recipes. The “nog”part of its name may stem
from the word noggin, a Middle English term for a small,
carved wooden mug used to serve alcohol.* [3] However,
the British drink was also called an Egg Flip, from the
practice of “ﬂipping”(rapidly pouring) the mixture between two pitchers to mix it.
One very early example: Isaac Weld, Junior, in his book
Travels Through the States of North America and the
Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, during the years
1795, 1796, and 1797 (published in 1800) wrote: “The
American travellers, before they pursued their journey,
took a hearty draught each, according to custom, of eggnog, a mixture composed of new milk, eggs, rum, and

Traditional eggnog typically consists of milk, sugar and raw eggs.

eggnog-ﬂavored ice cream.

59.5 Safety concerns
While alcohol is a bactericide, eggnog freshly-made made
from eggs infected with salmonella and not heated can
cause food poisoning. In 1982 most of the residents
and staﬀ of a nursing home in the USA became ill with
salmonella poisoning, and four died. The cause was almost certainly an eggnog made on the spur of the moment, with some cases caused in a secondary outbreak
caused by food being handled later by people with contaminated hands.* [8] A later publication of the US FDA
states that the alcohol in egg-nog is not suﬃcient to
sterilise contaminated eggs.* [9] Using commercial pasteurised eggs, or heating the milk-egg mixture appropriately, make the drink safe; one recipe calls for heating the
mixture gently, without boiling, until it thickens enough
to “coat the back of a spoon”* [10].
However, aged eggnog becomes sterilised even if made
with contaminated eggs. Allowing alcoholic eggnog to
mature̶sometimes for as long as a year̶improves its
ﬂavour signiﬁcantly, and also destroys pathogens. Rockefeller's Laboratory of Bacterial Pathogenesis and Immunology carried out an experiment in 2010 where
salmonella was added to a strong egg-nog which was refrigerated and stored; the beverage still had dangerous
levels of salmonella a week later, but it was all gone
within three weeks. A concentration of at least 20% of
alcohol (about the same amounts of alcoholic spirits and
milk or cream), and refrigeration are recommended for
safety.* [11]* [12]
For concerns about the safety of selling products made
from raw eggs and milk, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has changed or altered the deﬁnition
of eggnog a number of times towards artiﬁcial replacements for the large number of eggs traditionally required.
Modern FDA regulations require eggnog to contain at
least 1% egg yolk solids and “milk or milk products.”

be cooked with milk into a custard to avoid potential hazards from raw eggs. (Some of these recipes call for any

alcohol will evaporate during cooking.) Eggnog has much

Green bean casserole
Green bean casserole is a casserole consisting of green
beans, cream of mushroom soup, and french fried onions.
It is a popular Thanksgiving side dish in the United States.

60.1 History of recipe
The green bean casserole was ﬁrst created in 1955 by the
Campbell Soup Company. Dorcas Reilly led the team
that created the recipe while working as a staﬀ member in
the home economics department.* [1] The inspiration for
the dish was to create a quick and easy recipe around two

Ham
This article is about the preserved uncooked leg of pork.
For the cooked leg of pork, see Gammon (meat). For
other uses, see Ham (disambiguation).
Ham is a processed pork food,* [1] which undergoes

The precise nature of meat termed“ham”is controlled,
often by statute, in a number of areas, including the
United States and European Union, meaning that only
products meeting a certain set of criteria can be called
ham. In addition, there are numerous ham products
which have speciﬁc geographical naming protection, such
as Prosciutto di Parma and Prosciutto Toscano PDO in
Europe, and Smithﬁeld ham in the US.

61.1 Deﬁnition
Ham has a number of deﬁnitions, and its meaning has
evolved over time. Ham was originally the cut of pork
deriving from the hind legs of swine, which was then often
preserved through processes such as curing, smoking, or
salting. Cooked leg of pork is called gammon.
Because of the preservation process, ham is a compound
foodstuﬀ or ingredient, being made up of the original
meat, as well as the remnants of the preserving agent(s),
such as salt, but it is still recognised as a food in its own
right.* [3]

Typical slice of ham

In many countries the term is now protected by statute,
with a speciﬁc deﬁnition. For instance, in the United
States, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) says that
“the word 'ham', without any preﬁx indicating the species
of animal from which derived, shall be used in labeling
only in connection with the hind legs of swine”.* [4]

Whole ham

preservation through curing, smoking, or salting. Ham
was traditionally made only from the hind leg of swine,
and referred to that speciﬁc cut of pork.* [2] Ham is made
around the world, including a number of regional specialties, although the term now has wider usage and can also
be used to refer to meat which has been through a process
of re-forming.

In addition to the main categories, some processing
choices can aﬀect legal labeling. For instance, in the
United States, a“smoked”ham must have been smoked
by hanging over burning wood chips in a smokehouse or
an atomized spray of liquid smoke such that the product
appearance is equivalent; a "hickory-smoked”ham must
have been smoked using only hickory. However, injecting “smoke ﬂavor”is not legal grounds for claiming the
ham was “smoked"; these are labeled “smoke ﬂavor
added”. Hams can only be labelled “honey-cured”if
honey was at least 50% of the sweetener used, is at least
3% of the formula, and has a discernible eﬀect on ﬂavor.
So-called “lean”and “extra lean”hams must adhere
to maximum levels of fat and cholesterol per 100 grams
of product.

248

61.4. METHOD

249

Ham re-formed from smaller pieces in to a larger block
also has to be labelled in many jurisdictions.

61.2 Etymology
The word “ham”is derived from the Old English ham
or hom meaning the hollow or bend of the knee, from a
Germanic base where it meant “crooked”. It gained
the meaning of the leg of an animal around the 15th century.* [5]

61.3 History
The preserving of pork leg as ham has a long history, with
Cato the Elder writing about the“salting of hams” his
in
De Agri Cultura tome around 160 BC.* [6]
There are claims that the Chinese were the ﬁrst people
to mention the production of raw cured ham,* [7] whilst

61.4 Method

The dry curing of ham involves a number of enzymatic
reactions.
The enzymes involved are proteinases
(cathepsins – B, D, H & L, and calpains) and
exopeptidases (peptidase and aminopeptidase).* [14]

piece of meat, with gradients determinable through sampling and testing or non-invasively through CT scanning.* [17]

61.4.2

Wet curing

Wet curing involves the immersion of the meat in a brine,
sometimes with other ingredients such as sugar also added
for ﬂavour. Meat is submerged in the brine for around
3–14 days, during which time the meat needs to be kept
submerged, and the brine mixture agitated periodically to
prevent separation of the ingredients.* [9]
Wet curing also has the eﬀect of increasing volume and
weight of the ﬁnished product, by about 4%.
The wet curing process can also be replicated by using
mechanical pumping using needles and curing solution.
This can be quicker, increase the weight of the ﬁnished
product by more than immersion wet curing, and ensure
a more even distribution of salt through the meat. This
process is quicker than traditional wet cure, normally being completed between a few days and a few weeks.* [18]

New dishes made from leftovers are quite common in
world cuisine, and many were created in the days before
refrigeration and reliable airtight containers existed. Besides capturing nutrition from otherwise inedible bones,
stocks and broths make an excellent base for adding
leftover morsels too small to be a meal themselves.
Casseroles,* [1] paella, fried rice,* [2] and pizza can also
be used for this purpose, and may even have been invented as a means of reusing leftovers. Among American university students, leftover pizza itself has acquired

Leftovers from a restaurant meal may either be left behind to be discarded by the restaurant, or taken away by
the diner for later consumption. In order to take the food
away, the diner may make a request for it to be packaged. The container used for such leftovers is commonly
called a doggy bag or doggie bag. It is speculated that
this derives from the euphemistic pretense that the food
will be given to the diner's pet, rather than eaten by a person.* [5] However it may also be a corruption of the East
Anglian term docky, meaning lunch. The term doggy bag

Mashed potato
This article is about the food. For other uses, see Mashed
potato (disambiguation).

63.2 Culinary uses

Mashed potato is a dish prepared by mashing boiled
potatoes. Recipes started appearing no later than
1747 with an entry in The Art of Cookery by Hannah
Glasse.* [1] Dehydrated and frozen mashed potatoes are
available in many places.

63.1 Ingredients
The use of “ﬂoury”types of potato is usually recommended, although “waxy”potatoes are sometimes used
for a diﬀerent texture.* [2] Butter, vegetable oil, milk
and/or cream are usually added to improve ﬂavor and
texture, and the potatoes are seasoned with salt, pepper,
and any other desired herbs and spices. Popular ingredients and seasonings include: garlic, cheese, bacon
bits, sour cream, crisp onion or spring onion, mustard,
spices such as nutmeg, chopped herbs such as parsley or
rosemary, white turnip, and wasabi. One French variation adds egg yolk for pommes duchesse or Duchess potatoes; piped through a pastry tube into wavy ribbons and
rosettes, brushed with butter and lightly browned. Pomme
purée (potato puree) uses considerably more butter than
normal mashed potato - up to two parts potato for one
part butter.* [2]* [3] In low-calorie or non-dairy variations,
milk, cream and butter may be replaced by soup stock
or broth. Aloo Bharta, an Indian sub-continent variation,
uses chopped onions, mustard (oil, paste or seeds), chili
pepper, coriander leaves and other spices.

Mashed potato served with Frankfurter Rippchen, sauerkraut
and mustard

Mashed potatoes can be served together with other
dishes, or can be an ingredient of various other dishes,
including shepherd's and cottage pie, pierogi, colcannon,
dumplings, potato croquettes, gnocchi, etc. It is often
served with sausages as bangers and mash.
A potato masher is a utensil which can be used to prepare
the potatoes.

Pecan pie
For the ﬁlm, see Pecan Pie (ﬁlm).
Pecan pie is a pie made primarily with corn syrup and
pecan nuts.* [1] Variations may include white or brown
sugar, sugar syrup, molasses, maple syrup, or honey.* [1]
It is popularly served at holiday meals and is also considered a specialty of Southern U.S. cuisine. Most pecan pie
recipes include salt and vanilla as ﬂavorings. Chocolate
and bourbon whiskey are other popular additions to the
recipe.* [2] Pecan pie is often served with whipped cream
or vanilla ice cream.

64.1 Origin

Dooley handed them a basket stuﬀed with
fruit, nuts, candy, a tinned ham, and a pecan
pie. “Merry Christmas!" he said.
̶Jan Karon, A Light in the Window* [8]

Claims have been made of the dish existing in the early
1800s in Alabama, but this does not appear to be backed
up by recipes or literature.* [3] Attempts to trace the
dish's origin have not found any recipes dated earlier than
1886,* [4] * [5] and well-known cookbooks such as Fannie
Farmer and The Joy of Cooking did not include this
dessert before 1940.* [4] The earliest recorded recipes
produce a boiled custard with pecans added, which is then
baked in a pie crust.* [4]

The only kitchen item I usually bring to
Italy is plastic wrap... This time, however, I
have brought one bag of Georgia pecans and a
can of cane syrup, pecan pie being a necessary
ingredient of Christmas.
̶Frances Mayes, Under the Tuscan Sun* [9]

Some have stated that the French invented pecan pie soon
after settling in New Orleans, after being introduced to
the pecan nut by Native Americans. Pecan pie may be a
variant of chess pie, which is made with a similar butter- Pecan pie is a staple of the Southern U.S., and is often

Pumpkin pie
Pumpkin pie is a traditional sweet dessert, often
eaten during the fall and early winter, especially for
Thanksgiving and Christmas in the United States and
Canada. The pumpkin is a symbol of harvest time and
featured also at Halloween.

are frequently used. Sometimes the pumpkin halves are
brined to soften the pulp, rather than cooked. At this
point the pulp is scooped out and pureed in a blender,
to ensure its consistency. The blended and cooked pulp's
texture is comparable to that in a canned product.

The pie consists of a pumpkin-based custard, ranging in
color from orange to brown, baked in a single pie shell,
rarely with a top crust. The pie is generally ﬂavored
with cinnamon, powdered ginger, nutmeg, and cloves.
Allspice is also commonly used, and can replace the clove
and nutmeg as its ﬂavor is similar to both combined.
Cardamom and vanilla are also sometimes used as batter spices.

This pulp is then mixed with eggs, evaporated and/or
sweetened condensed milk, sugar, nutmeg, and other
spices (e.g., ginger, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, mace),
then baked in a pie shell.* [1] Some recipes may also call
for substitutes to be used, such as butternut squash instead
of pumpkin.

This pie is usually made from canned pumpkin or packaged pumpkin pie ﬁlling (spices included), mainly from
varieties of Cucurbita moschata.

65.2 History
The pumpkin is native to the continent of North America. The oldest evidence, pumpkin-related seeds dating
between 7000 and 5500 BCE, has been found in Mexico.
The pumpkin was an early export to France; from there
it was introduced to Tudor England, and the ﬂesh of the
“pompion”was quickly accepted as pie ﬁller. During the
seventeenth century, pumpkin pie recipes could be found in
English cookbooks'such as Hannah Woolley's The Gentlewoman's Companion, which was published in 1675.* [2]
The recipes did not appear in American cookbooks until
the early nineteenth century.* [2] Pumpkin pie did not become a common addition to the Thanksgiving dinner until
the early nineteenth century.* [2] The Pilgrims brought the
pumpkin pie back to New England,* [3] while the English
method of cooking the pumpkin took a diﬀerent course.
In the 19th century, the English pumpkin pie was prepared
by stuﬃng the pumpkin with apples, spices, and sugar and
then baking it whole.* [4]* [5]

65.1 Preparation

Pumpkin pie ﬁlling being made

The traditional method for preparing a pumpkin pie involves the use of a “pie pumpkin”which is about six to
eight inches in diameter,* [1] which is smaller than a "jack
o'lantern" sized pumpkin. The pumpkin is sliced in half,
and the seeds removed. The two halves are heated until
soft. This was traditionally done either in an oven or over
an open ﬁre, but nowadays, stove tops and microwaves

Many companies produce seasonal pumpkin pie-ﬂavored
products such as ice cream, coﬀee, cheesecake, pancakes,
candy, and beer. Many breweries produce a seasonal
pumpkin ale, and the Pumpkin Spice Latte is one of
the most popular seasonal items sold during the autumn months at Starbucks. Throughout much of the
United States it is traditional to serve pumpkin pie after Thanksgiving dinner. Commercially made pumpkin
pie mix is made from Cucurbita pepo, Cucurbita maxima,
and Cucurbita moschata ('Libbey Select' uses the Select

66.2 Culinary arts

Roast beef is a dish of beef which is roasted in an oven.
Essentially prepared as a main meal, the leftovers can be
and are often served within sandwiches and sometimes
are used to make hash. In the United Kingdom, United
States, Canada, Ireland, and Australia, roast beef is one of
the meats traditionally served at Sunday dinner, although
it is also often served as a cold cut in delicatessen stores,
usually in sandwiches. A traditional side dish to roast beef
is Yorkshire pudding.
Roast beef is a signature national dish of England and
holds cultural meaning for the English dating back to the
1731 ballad "The Roast Beef of Old England". The dish
is so synonymous with England and its cooking methods

The beef on weck sandwich is a tradition in western New
York. Roast beef is sometimes served with horseradish or
horseradish sauce. In Denmark it is mostly used in open
sandwiches, called smørrebrød.

Some trace the origins of the modern (U.S. based) roast
beef sandwich as far back as 1877, with the then little
known “beefsteak toast”recipe: cold beef, bread and
gravy dish.* [3] In 1900, the dish was described by The
and
Washington Post as“unattractive” as“a tired ark in
a gravy ﬂood” The dish gained popularity in the coming

years and by 1931, some critics even went as far as to
describe it as “a true taste of South Dakota".* [4]

It is not known when stuﬃngs were ﬁrst used. The earliest
documentary evidence is the Roman cookbook, Apicius
'"De Re Coquinaria”, which contains recipes for stuﬀed
chicken, hare, pig, and dormouse. Most of the stuﬃngs
described consist of vegetables, herbs and spices, nuts,
and spelt (an old cereal), and frequently contain chopped
liver, brains, and other organ meat.* [1]
Names for stuﬃng include 'farce' (~1390), 'stuﬃng'
(1538), 'forcemeat' (1688), and 'dressing'.* [2] After
about 1880, the term stuﬃng was replaced by dressing
in Victorian English.

67.2 Cavities
In addition to stuﬃng the body cavity of animals, including mammals, birds, and ﬁsh, various cuts of meat may be
stuﬀed after they have been deboned or a pouch has been

Turkey stuﬃng usually consists of dried bread, croutons

Many types of vegetables are also suitable for stuﬃng
after their seeds or ﬂesh has been removed. Tomatoes,

inserted between the individual leaves.
It is sometimes claimed that the ancient Roman, as well as
medieval, cooks stuﬀed animals with other animals. An
anonymous Andalusian cookbook from the 13th century
includes a recipe for a ram stuﬀed with small birds. A
similar recipe for a camel stuﬀed with sheep stuﬀed with
bustards stuﬀed with carp stuﬀed with eggs is mentioned
in T.C. Boyle's book Water Music.
British celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall has
championed the ten-bird roast, calling it“one of the most
spectacular and delicious roasts you can lay before your
loved ones at Yuletide”. A large turkey is stuﬀed with
a goose, duck, mallard, guinea fowl, chicken, pheasant,
partridge, pigeon and woodcock. The roast feeds around
30 people and, as well as the ten birds, also includes stuﬀing made from two pounds of sausage meat and half a
pound of streaky bacon along with sage, port and red
wine.* [3]

In the United States and Eastern Canada, multi-bird
dishes are sometimes served on special occasions. See
Turducken and Gooducken.

Stuﬀed tomatoes

Almost anything can serve as a stuﬃng, many popular
Anglo-American stuﬃngs contain bread or cereals, usually together with vegetables, herbs and spices, and eggs.
Middle Eastern vegetable stuﬃngs may be based on seasoned rice, on minced meat, or a combination. Other
stuﬃngs may contain only vegetables and herbs. Some
types of stuﬃng contain sausage meat, or forcemeat,
while vegetarian stuﬃngs sometimes contain tofu. Oysters are used in one traditional stuﬃng for Thanksgiving.
These may also be combined with mashed potatoes, for
a heavy stuﬃng. Fruits and dried fruits can be added
to stuﬃng including apples, dried prunes, apricots, and
raisins. In England, a popular stuﬃng is sausage meat
seasoned with various ingredients, sage, onion, apple, etc.
The stuﬃng mixture may be cooked separately and served
as a side dish, in which case it may still be called 'stuﬃng',
or in some regions, such as the Southern US, 'dressing'.

vegetable.* [1]* [2] The young leaves and shoots are sometimes eaten as greens. Ipomoea batatas is native to
the tropical regions in America.* [3]* [4] Of the approximately 50 genera and more than 1,000 species of Convolvulaceae, I. batatas is the only crop plant of major
importance̶some others are used locally, but many are
poisonous. The sweet potato is only distantly related to
the potato (Solanum tuberosum) and does not belong to
the nightshade family.

68.2 Origin, distribution and diversity

The genus Ipomoea that contains the sweet potato also
includes several garden ﬂowers called morning glories,
though that term is not usually extended to Ipomoea
batatas. Some cultivars of Ipomoea batatas are grown as
ornamental plants; the name “tuberous morning glory”
may be used in a horticultural context.
The plant is a herbaceous perennial vine, bearing alternate heart-shaped or palmately lobed leaves and mediumsized sympetalous ﬂowers. The edible tuberous root is
long and tapered, with a smooth skin whose color ranges
between yellow, orange, red, brown, purple, and beige.
Its ﬂesh ranges from beige through white, red, pink, vi- Sweet potatoes in the ﬁeld

with white or pale yellow ﬂesh are less sweet and moist
than those with red, pink or orange ﬂesh.* [5]

68.1 Naming
In certain parts of the world, sweet potatoes are locally
known by other names.* [6] In New Zealand English, the
Māori term kūmara (also spelled kūmera) is commonly
used. Although the soft, orange sweet potato is often
called a “yam” in parts of North America, the sweet
potato is botanically very distinct from a genuine yam
(Dioscorea), which is native to Africa and Asia and belongs to the monocot family Dioscoreaceae. To add to the

Sweet potato tubers with diﬀerent skin colors, on sale in Indonesia. Locally these are known as ubi jalar (creeping yam).

The origin and domestication of sweet potato is thought
to be in either Central America or South America.* [9]
In Central America, sweet potatoes were domesticated at
least 5,000 years ago.* [10] In South America, Peruvian
sweet potato remnants dating as far back as 8000 BC have
been found.* [11]

268

68.2. ORIGIN, DISTRIBUTION AND DIVERSITY
One author postulated that the origin of I. batatas was between the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico and the mouth of
the Orinoco River in Venezuela.* [12] The 'cultigen' had
most likely been spread by local people to the Caribbean
and South America by 2500 BC.* [13] Strong supporting evidence was provided that the geographical zone
postulated by Austin is the primary center of diversity.* [12] The much lower molecular diversity found in
Peru–Ecuador suggests this region should be considered
as secondary center of sweet potato diversity.
The sweet potato was also grown before western exploration in Polynesia. Sweet potato has been radiocarbondated in the Cook Islands to 1000 AD, and current thinking is that it was brought to central Polynesia around 700
AD, possibly by Polynesians who had traveled to South
America and back, and spread across Polynesia to Hawaii
and New Zealand from there.* [14]* [15] It is possible,
however, that South Americans brought it to the Paciﬁc,
although this is unlikely as it was the Polynesians who
had a strong maritime tradition and not the native South
Americans. The theory that the plant could spread by
ﬂoating seeds across the ocean is not supported by evidence. Another point is that the sweet potato in Polynesia is the cultivated Ipomoea batatas, which is generally
spread by vine cuttings and not by seeds.* [16]
Sweet potatoes are now cultivated throughout tropical
and warm temperate regions wherever there is suﬃcient water to support their growth.* [17] Due to a major crop failure, sweet potatoes were introduced to Fujian
province of China in about 1594 from Luzon. The growing of sweet potatoes was encouraged by the Governor Chin Hsüeh-tseng (Jin Xuezeng).* [18]* [19] Sweet
potatoes were introduced as a food crop in Japan, and
by 1735 was planted in Shogun Tokugawa Yoshimune's
private garden.* [20] It was also introduced to Korea in
1764.* [21]
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) statistics, world production in 2004 was 127 million tonnes.* [22] The majority comes from China, with
a production of 105 million tonnes from 49,000 km2 .
About half of the Chinese crop is used for livestock
feed.* [10]
Per capita production is greatest in countries where sweet
potatoes are a staple of human consumption, led by Papua
New Guinea at about 500 kg* [23] per person per year, the
Solomon Islands at 160 kg, Burundi and Rwanda* [24] at
130 kg and Uganda at 100 kg.

The town of Opelousas, Louisiana's
“Yambilee” been
has
celebrated every October since 1946. The Frenchmen
who established the ﬁrst settlement at Opelousas in 1760
discovered the native Atakapa, Alabama, Choctaw, and
Appalousa tribes eating sweet potatoes. The sweet potato
became a favorite food item of the French and Spanish
settlers and thus continued a long history of cultivation in
Louisiana.* [28]
Mississippi has about 150 farmers growing sweet potatoes on about 8,200 acres (30 km2 ), contributing $19
million to the state's economy. Mississippi's top ﬁve
sweet potato producing counties are Calhoun, Chickasaw,
Pontotoc, Yalobusha, and Panola. The National Sweet
Potato Festival is held annually the entire ﬁrst week in
November in Vardaman (Calhoun County), which proclaims itself as “The Sweet Potato Capital”.
The town of Benton, Kentucky, celebrates the sweet
potato annually with its Tater Day Festival on the ﬁrst
Monday of April. The town of Gleason, Tennessee, celebrates the sweet potato on Labor Day weekend with its
Tater Town Special.
Sweet potatoes became popular very early in the islands
of the Paciﬁc Ocean, spreading from Polynesia to Japan
and the Philippines. One reason is that they were a reliable crop in cases of crop failure of other staple foods
because of typhoon ﬂooding. They are featured in many
favorite dishes in Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, and
other island nations. Indonesia, Vietnam, India, and some
other Asian countries are also large sweet potato growers. Sweet potato, also known as kelang in Tulu is part
of Udupi cuisine. Uganda (the second largest grower after China), Rwanda, and some other African countries
also grow a large crop which is an important part of their
peoples' diets. The New World, the original home of the
sweet potato, grows less than three percent (3%) of the
world's supply. Europe has only a very small sweet potato
production, mainly in Portugal. In the Caribbean, a variety of the sweet potato called the boniato is popular.
The ﬂesh of the boniato is cream-colored, unlike the more
popular orange hue seen in other varieties. Boniatos are
not as sweet and moist as other sweet potatoes, but many
people prefer their ﬂuﬃer consistency and more delicate
ﬂavor.

About 20,000 tonnes of sweet potatoes are produced annually in New Zealand, where sweet potato is known by
its Māori name, kūmara. It was a staple food for Māori
before European contact.* [25]
In the U.S., North Carolina, the leading state in sweet
potato production, provided 38.5% of the 2007 U.S. production of sweet potatoes. In 2007, California produced
23%, Louisiana 15.9%, and Mississippi 19% of the U.S.
total.* [26]* [27]

CHAPTER 68. SWEET POTATO

Sweet potatoes have been an important part of the diet in
the United States for most of its history, especially in the
Southeast. From the middle of the 20th century however
they have become less popular. The average per capita
consumption of sweet potatoes in the United States is only
about 1.5–2 kg (3.3–4.4 lb) per year, down from 13 kg
(29 lb) in 1920. Southerner Kent Wrench writes: “The
Sweet Potato became associated with hard times in the
minds of our ancestors and when they became aﬄuent
enough to change their menu, the potato was served less
often.”* [29]

68.3 Cultivation

The softer, orange-ﬂeshed variety of sweet potato

The plant does not tolerate frost. It grows best at an average temperature of 24 °C (75 °F), abundant sunshine and
warm nights. Annual rainfalls of 750–1,000 mm (30–39
in) are considered most suitable, with a minimum of 500
mm (20 in) in the growing season. The crop is sensitive
to drought at the tuber initiation stage 50–60 days after
planting, and it is not tolerant to water-logging, as it may
cause tuber rots and reduce growth of storage roots if aeration is poor.* [31]
Depending on the cultivar and conditions, tuberous roots
mature in two to nine months. With care, early-maturing
cultivars can be grown as an annual summer crop in
temperate areas, such as the northern United States.
Sweet potatoes rarely ﬂower when the daylight is longer
than 11 hours, as is normal outside of the tropics. They
are mostly propagated by stem or root cuttings or by adventitious roots called “slips”that grow out from the

breeding only.
They grow well in many farming conditions and have
few natural enemies; pesticides are rarely needed. Sweet
potatoes are grown on a variety of soils, but well-drained,
light- and medium-textured soils with a pH range of 4.57.0 are more favorable for the plant.* [2] They can be
grown in poor soils with little fertilizer. However, sweet
potatoes are very sensitive to aluminum toxicity and will
die about six weeks after planting if lime is not applied
at planting in this type of soil.* [2] Because they are sown
by vine cuttings rather than seeds, sweet potatoes are relatively easy to plant. Because the rapidly growing vines
shade out weeds, little weeding is needed. In the tropics,
the crop can be maintained in the ground and harvested Naturalized sweet potato in the Philippines (locally known as

Besides simple starches, raw sweet potatoes are rich in
complex carbohydrates, dietary ﬁber and beta-carotene
(a provitamin A carotenoid), while having moderate
contents of other micronutrients, including vitamin B5,
vitamin B6 , manganese and potassium (right table).* [36]
When cooked by baking, small variable changes in micronutrient content occur to include a higher content of
vitamin C at 24% of the Daily Value per 100 g serving
(right table),* [37] as well as an increase in polyphenol levels.* [38]
The Center for Science in the Public Interest has compared the nutritional value of sweet potatoes to other
foods.* [39] Considering ﬁber content, complex carbohydrates, protein, vitamin A and potassium, the sweet
potato ranked highest in nutritional value.
Sweet potato varieties with dark orange ﬂesh have more
beta carotene than those with light-colored ﬂesh, and their
increased cultivation is being encouraged in Africa, where
vitamin A deﬁciency is a serious health problem. A 2012
study of 10,000 households in Uganda found that 50%

Although the leaves and shoots are also edible, the starchy
tuberous roots are by far the most important product. In
some tropical areas, they are a staple food crop.

68.5.1 Africa
Amukeke (sun-dried slices of root) and inginyo (sun-dried
crushed root) are a staple food for people in northeastern Uganda.* [42] Amukeke is mainly served for breakfast,
eaten with peanut sauce. Inginyo is mixed with cassava
ﬂour and tamarind to make atapa. People eat atapa with
smoked ﬁsh cooked in peanut sauce or with dried cowpea
leaves cooked in peanut sauce. Emukaru (earth baked
root) is eaten as a snack anytime and is mostly served with
tea or with peanut sauce. Similar uses are also found in
South Sudan.
The young leaves and vine tips of sweet potato leaves are
widely consumed as a vegetable in West African countries
(Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, for example), as well
as in northeastern Uganda, East Africa.* [42] According
to FAO leaﬂet No. 13 - 1990, sweet potato leaves and

In Kenya Rhoda Nungo of the home economics department of the Ministry of Agriculture has written a guide
to using sweet potatoes in modern recipes.* [43] This includes uses both in the mashed form and as ﬂour from the
dried tubers to replace part of the wheat ﬂour and sugar in
baked products such as cakes, chapatis, mandazis, bread,
buns and cookies. A nutritious juice drink is made from
the orange ﬂeshed varieties, and deep fried snacks are also
included.
In Egypt, sweet potato tubers are known as “batata”
(‫ )بطاطا‬are a common street food in winter, where street
vendors with carts ﬁtted with ovens sell them to people
passing time by the Nile or the sea. The two varieties
used are the orange ﬂeshed one as well as the white/cream
ﬂeshed one. They are also baked at homes as a snack or
dessert, drenched with honey.

In Korea, sweet potatoes are baked in foil or in open
ﬁre, typically during winter. In Korean, sweet potatoes
are called “Goguma”. In Japan, this is called yakiimo (roasted sweet potato), which typically uses either
the yellow-ﬂeshed Japanese sweet potato or the purpleﬂeshed (Okinawan) sweet potato, which is known as beniimo.

Sweet potato soup, served during winter, consists of boiling sweet potato in water with rock sugar and ginger.
Sweet potato greens are a common side dish in Taiwanese
cuisine, often boiled or sautéed and served with a garlic
and soy sauce mixture, or simply salted before serving.
They, as well as dishes featuring the sweet potato root, are
commonly found at bento (Pe̍ h-ōe-jī: piān-tong) restaurants. In northeastern Chinese cuisine, sweet potatoes are
often cut into chunks and fried, before being drenched
into a pan of boiling syrup.* [45]

In some regions of India, fasts of religious nature are an
occasion for a change in normal diet, and a total absence

as part of the meal. In Indian state of Tamil Nadu, it is
known as 'Sakkara valli Kilangu'. It is boiled and consumed as evening snack. In some parts of India, fresh
sweet potato is chipped, dried and then ground into ﬂour;
this is then mixed with wheat ﬂour and baked into chapattis (bread). Between 15 to 20 percent of sweet potato harvest is converted by some Indian communities into pickles and snack chips. A part of the tuber harvest is used in
India as cattle fodder.* [5]
The tubers of this plant, known as kattala in Dhivehi, have
been used in the traditional diet of the Maldives. The
leaves were ﬁnely chopped and used in dishes such as mas
huni.* [46]
In Japan, both sweet potatoes (called “satsuma-imo”)
and true purple yams (called “daijo”or “beni-imo”
) are grown. Boiled sweet potato is the most common
way to eat it at home. Steaming sweet potatoes is also
a common cooking method in Japan. Also, the use in
vegetable tempura is common. Daigaku-imo is a baked
sweet potato dessert. Because it is sweet and starchy, it
is used in imo-kinton and some other wagashi (Japanese
sweets), such as ofukuimo. Shōchū, a Japanese spirit normally made from the fermentation of rice, can also be
made from sweet potato, in which case it is called imojōchū. Imo-gohan, sweet potato cooked with rice, is popular in Guangdong, Taiwan and Japan. It is also served in
nimono or nitsuke, boiled and typically ﬂavored with soy
sauce, mirin and dashi.

In Malaysia and Singapore, sweet potato is often cut into
small cubes and cooked with yam and coconut milk (santan) to make a sweet dessert called bubur caca. A favorite way of cooking sweet potato is deep frying slices
of sweet potato in batter, and served as a tea-time snack.
In homes, sweet potatoes are usually boiled. The leaves
of sweet potatoes are usually stir-fried with only garlic or
with sambal belacan and dried shrimp by Malaysians.
In the Philippines, sweet potatoes (locally known as
camote or kamote) are an important food crop in rural
areas. They are often a staple among impoverished families in provinces, as they are easier to cultivate and cost
less than rice.* [47] The tubers are boiled or baked in
coals and may be dipped in sugar or syrup. Young leaves
and shoots (locally known as talbos ng kamote or camote
tops) are eaten fresh in salads with shrimp paste (bagoong alamang) or ﬁsh sauce. They can be cooked in
vinegar and soy sauce and served with fried ﬁsh (a dish
known as adobong talbos ng kamote), or with recipes such
as sinigang.* [47] The stew obtained from boiling camote
tops is purple-colored, and is often mixed with lemon as
juice. Sweet potatoes are also sold as street food in suburban and rural areas. Fried sweet potatoes coated with
caramelized sugar and served in skewers (camote cue)
are popular afternoon snacks.* [48] Sweet potatoes are
also used in a variant of halo-halo called ginatan, where
they are cooked in coconut milk and sugar and mixed
with a variety of rootcrops, sago, jackfruit and bilu-bilo
(glutinous rice balls).* [49] Bread made from sweet potato
ﬂour is also gaining popularity. Sweet potato is relatively
easy to propagate, and in rural areas that can be seen
abundantly at canals and dikes. The uncultivated plant
is usually fed to pigs.
In the mountainous regions of West Papua, sweet potatoes are the staple food among the natives there. Using
the bakar batu way of cooking (free translation: burning
rocks), rocks that have been burned in a nearby bonﬁre
are thrown into a pit lined with leaves. Layers of sweet
potatoes, an assortment of vegetables, and pork are piled
on top of the rocks. The top of the pile then is insulated
with more leaves, creating a pressure of heat and steam
inside which cooks all food within the pile after several
hours. In most parts of Indonesia, sweet potatoes are frequently fried with batter and served as snacks.

Imomeigetsu, also known as Tsukimi, is a Japanese festival honoring the beauty of autumn moon. Sake and sweet potatoes
are oﬀered to the moon, with prayers for an abundant harvest. Dishes made of sweet potato are ubiquitous. Shown here
is Tsukimi dango.

In Korean cuisine, sweet potato starch is used to produce
dangmyeon (cellophane noodles). Sweet potatoes are also
boiled, steamed, or roasted, and young stems are eaten as
namul. Pizza restaurants such as Pizza Hut and Domino's
in Korea are using sweet potatoes as a popular topping.
Sweet potatoes are also used in the distillation of a variety
of Soju.

68.5.3 North America
Candied sweet potatoes are a side dish consisting
mainly of sweet potatoes prepared with brown sugar,
marshmallows, maple syrup, molasses, orange juice,
marron glacé, or other sweet ingredients. It is often
served in America on Thanksgiving. Sweet potato casserole is a side dish of mashed sweet potatoes in a casserole
dish, topped with a brown sugar and pecan topping.* [50]
Sweet potato pie is also a traditional favorite dish in
Southern U.S. cuisine. Sweet potato slices are fried in bacon drippings and eaten with the bacon on toast. Sweet

potato fries or chips are another common preparation,
and are made by julienning and deep frying sweet potatoes, in the fashion of French fried potatoes. Sweet potato
fries are used with a variety of condiments such as Blue
Cheese. Baked sweet potatoes are sometimes oﬀered in
restaurants as an alternative to baked potatoes. They are
often topped with brown sugar and butter. Sweet potato
butter can be cooked into a gourmet spread. Sweet potato
mash is served as a side dish, often at Thanksgiving dinner or with barbecue. John Buttencourt Avila is called
the father of the sweet potato industry in North America.

Island near Dargaville* [58] and widely available throughout New Zealand year-round, where they are a popular
alternative to potatoes.* [59] The red variety has dull red
skin and purple-streaked white ﬂesh, and is the most popular. The orange variety is the same as the American
“Beauregard”variety. The gold kumara has pale, yellowish skin and ﬂesh.

In the Veneto (northeast Italy), sweet potato is known as
patata mericana in the Venetian language (patata americana in Italian, meaning “American potato”), and it
is cultivated above all in the southern area of the region;* [63] it is a traditional fall dish, boiled or roasted.
Young sweet potato leaves are also used as baby food
particularly in Southeast Asia and East Asia.* [64]* [65]
Mashed sweet potato tubers are used similarly throughout the world.* [66]

to taste sweet potatoes were members of Columbus's expedition in 1492. Later explorers found many varieties
under an assortment of local names, but the name which
stayed was the indigenous Taino name of batata. This
name was later transmuted to the similar name for a different vegetable, the ordinary potato, causing confusion
from which it never recovered. The ﬁrst record of the
name“sweet potato” found in the Oxford English Dicis

Sweet potato pie
Sweet potato pie is a traditional side dish in the Southern
United States. It is often served during the American holiday season, especially at Thanksgiving, and is similar in
many ways to pumpkin pie. Marshmallows are sometimes added as a topping, but this was adopted more in
the Northern United States than in the South.
It is usually made as a large tart in an open pie shell without a top crust. The ﬁlling consists of mashed sweet potatoes, milk, sugar and eggs, ﬂavored with spices such as
nutmeg. Other possible ingredients include vanilla or banana extracts. The baked custard ﬁlling may vary from a
light and silky to dense, depending on the recipe's ratio
of mashed potato, milk and eggs.
Though creamy vegetable pie recipes date back to Medieval Europe, sweet potato pie appears in the southern United States from the early colonial days.* [1] Like
many sweet potato recipes, sweet potato pie was likely
developed by African-American slaves from traditional
African cuisine, making it a staple of soul food today.* [2]
Recipes for sweet potato pie ﬁrst appeared in printed
cookbooks in the 18th century, where it was included
with savory vegetable dishes. By the 19th century, sweet
potato pie was more commonly classiﬁed as a dessert.* [1]

Turducken
Accessed November 21, 2007</ref>

70.1 Variations
In the United Kingdom, a turducken is a type of ballotine
called a “three-bird roast”or a “royal roast”. The
Pure Meat Company oﬀered a ﬁve-bird roast (a goose,
a turkey, a chicken, a pheasant, and a pigeon, stuﬀed
with sausage), described as a modern revival of the traditional Yorkshire Christmas pie, in 1989;* [2]* [3] and a
three-bird roast (a duck stuﬀed with chicken stuﬀed with
a pigeon, with sage and apple stuﬃng) in 1990.* [2]* [3]
Multi-bird roasts are widely available.
30 lb. roasted turducken

Sausage-stuﬀed turducken cut into quarters to show the internal
layers

Turducken is a dish consisting of a deboned chicken
stuﬀed into a deboned duck, which is in turn stuﬀed into
a deboned turkey. The word. turducken is a portmanteau
of turkey, duck, and chicken. The dish is a form of
engastration, which is a recipe method in which one animal is stuﬀed inside the gastric passage of another.* [1]

In his 1807 Almanach des Gourmands, gastronomist Grimod de La Reynière presents his rôti sans pareil (“roast
without equal” bustard stuﬀed with a turkey, a goose,
)̶a
a pheasant, a chicken, a duck, a guinea fowl, a teal, a
woodcock, a partridge, a plover, a lapwing, a quail, a
thrush, a lark, an ortolan bunting and a garden warbler
̶although he states that, since similar roasts were produced by ancient Romans, the rôti sans pareil was not entirely novel.* [3]* [4]* [5] The ﬁnal bird is very small but
large enough to just hold an olive; it also suggests that,
unlike modern multi-bird roasts, there was no stuﬃng or
other packing placed in between the birds.
Gooducken is a goose stuﬀed with a duck, which is in turn
stuﬀed with a chicken.* [4]
An early form of the recipe was Pandora's cushion, a
goose stuﬀed with a chicken stuﬀed with a quail.* [5]

Another version of the dish is credited to French diplomat
and gourmand Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord.
The 1891 newspaper article French Legends Of The Table
oﬀers Quail a la Talleyrand:* [6]

some versions have a diﬀerent stuﬃng for each bird. The
fanciful and somewhat roundabout way of

Bresse chicken; then sew up the opening, and

you put the chicken inside a ﬁne Berri turkey,
and roast the turkey very carefully before a

juice of the turkey is absorbed by the fowl, and
all the juice of the fowl in its turn by the quail.
After two hours roasting the fowl, which in reality it composed of three fowls, is ready, and
you place the steaming trinity upon a dish of

the chicken out of the turkey, and the quail out
of the chicken. The quail? Is it correct to talk
of the quail, when this delicious, perfumed dish
is indeed too good for any name? You take the
quail as you would some sacred relic, and serve
it hot, steaming, with its aroma of truﬄes, after
having roasted it to a golden yellow by basting
it diligently with the best Gournay butter.
The book Passion India: The Story of the Spanish Princess
of Kapurthula* [7] (p.295) features a section that recounts
a similar dish in India in the late 1800s: “Invited by Maharajah Ganga Singh to the most extraordinary of dinners, in the palace at Bikaner, when Anita asks her host
for the recipe of such a succulent dish, he answers her seriously, “Prepare a whole camel, skinned and cleaned,
put a goat inside it, and inside the goat a turkey and inside
the turkey a chicken. Stuﬀ the chicken with a grouse and
inside that put a quail and ﬁnally inside that a sparrow.
Then season it all well, place the camel in a hole in the
ground and roast it.”

70.2 In popular culture
American football commentator John Madden mentioned turducken during a National Football League
broadcast. While announcing for CBS Sports he displayed a turducken and began carving it. He promoted
it again on Fox Sports by awarding a turducken to players
on the winning team of the Thanksgiving Bowl. On the
November 9, 2008 broadcast of NBC Sunday Night Football, Madden responded to a fan's sign reading “JOHN
MADDEN, BRING BACK TURDUCKEN”by calling
his ﬁxation with turducken“a thing of the past,”stating
that he would return to a traditional turkey for subsequent
Thanksgivings.* [8]

Winter squash is a summer-growing annual fruit, representing several squash species within the genus Cucurbita.
It diﬀers from summer squash in that it is harvested and
eaten in the mature fruit stage, when the seeds within have
matured fully and the skin has hardened into a tough rind.
At this stage, most varieties of this fruit can be stored for
use during the winter. It is generally cooked before eating.* [1]

should be avoided when handling. Fruits that are not
fully mature, have been injured, have had their stems
knocked oﬀ, or have been subjected to heavy frost will
rot and should be used as soon as possible or be composted (watch for seedlings in the compost).

71.1 Planting
Because squash is a frost-tender plant, the seeds do not
germinate in cold soil. Winter squash seeds germinate

Thanksgiving dinner
According to what traditionally is known as “The First
Thanksgiving,”the 1621 feast between the Pilgrims and
the Wampanoag at Plymouth Colony contained turkey,
waterfowl, venison, ﬁsh, lobster, clams, berries, fruit,
pumpkin, and squash. William Bradford noted that,“besides waterfowl, there was great store of wild turkeys, of
*
which they took many.” [2] Many of the foods that were
included in the ﬁrst feast (except, notably, the seafood)
have since gone on to become staples of the modern
Thanksgiving dinner.

A traditional Thanksgiving dinner

The centerpiece of contemporary Thanksgiving in the
United States and Canada is a large meal, generally centered on a large roasted turkey. The majority of the
dishes in the traditional American version of Thanksgiving dinner are made from foods native to the New World,
as according to tradition the Pilgrims received these foods
from the Native Americans. However, many of the classic traditions attributed to the ﬁrst Thanksgiving are actually myths later introduced.* [1]

72.1 Historical menus

The use of the turkey in the USA for Thanksgiving precedes Lincoln's nationalization of the holiday in 1863.
Alexander Hamilton proclaimed that no “Citizen of the
United States should refrain from turkey on Thanksgiving Day,” many of the Founding Fathers (particularly
and
Benjamin Franklin) had high regard for the wild turkey as
an American icon, but turkey was uncommon as Thanksgiving fare until after 1800. By 1857, turkey had become
part of the traditional dinner in New England.* [3]
A Thanksgiving Day dinner served to the Civilian
Conservation Corps in 1935 included: pickles, green
olives, celery, roast turkey, oyster stew, cranberry sauce,
giblet gravy, dressing, creamed asparagus tips, snowﬂake
potatoes, baked carrots, hot rolls, fruit salad, mince meat
pie, fruit cake, candies, grapes, apples, clams, ﬁsh, and
many other food harvests. French drip coﬀee, cigars and
cigarettes.* [4]
The White House Cook Book, 1887, by Mrs. F.L. Gillette,
et al., had the following menu: oysters on half shell, cream
of chicken soup, fried smelts, sauce tartare, roast turkey,
cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, baked squash, boiled
onions, parsnip fritters, olives, chicken salad, venison
pastry, pumpkin pie, mince pie, Charlotte russe, almond
ice cream, lemon jelly, hickory nut cake, cheese, fruits
and coﬀee.* [5]

72.2 Turkey

1943 Thanksgiving Day dinner menu from USS Wake Island
(CVE-65)

Turkey being the most common main dish of a Thanksgiving dinner, Thanksgiving is sometimes colloquially
called “Turkey Day.”In 2006, American turkey growers were expected to raise 270 million turkeys, to be pro-

for example, a Chinese recipe for goose could be used on
the similarly-sized American bird. Vegetarians or vegans
may have a tofu-based substitute; a Field Roast, which is
a wheat-based product; or a special seasonal dish, such as
stuﬀed squash. In Alaskan villages, whale meat is sometimes eaten. Irish immigrants have been known to have
prime rib of beef as their centerpiece since beef in Ireland was once a rarity; families would save up money for
this dish to signify newfound prosperity and hope.

In the United States, a globalist approach to Thanksgiving has become common with the impact of immigration. Basic “Thanksgiving”ingredients, or the intent
of the holiday, can be transformed to a variety of dishes
Oven roasted turkey
by using ﬂavors, techniques, and traditions from their
own cuisines. Others celebrate the holiday with a varicessed into ﬁve billion pounds of turkey meat valued at al- ety of dishes particularly when there is a crowd to be fed,

per capita consumption of almost 18 pounds (8.2 kg).* [6]
The Broad Breasted White turkey is particularly bred for
Thanksgiving dinner and similar large feasts; its large size

(specimens can grow to over 40 pounds) and meat content make it ideal for such situations, although the breed
must be artiﬁcially bred and suﬀers from health problems
due to its size.
Most Thanksgiving turkeys are stuﬀed with a bread-based
mixture and roasted. Sage is the traditional herb added
to the stuﬃng (also called dressing), along with chopped
celery, carrots, and onions. Other ingredients, such as
chopped chestnuts or other tree nuts, crumbled sausage
or bacon, cranberries, raisins, or apples, may be added to
stuﬃng. Deep-fried turkey is rising in popularity due to
its shorter preparation time, but carries safety risks.

72.3 Alternatives to turkey
Non-traditional foods other than turkey are sometimes
served as the main dish for a Thanksgiving dinner. Ham is
often served alongside turkey in many households. Goose
and duck, foods which were traditional European centerpieces of Christmas dinners before being displaced,
are now sometimes served in place of the Thanksgiving turkey. Sometimes, fowl native to the region where
the meal is taking place is used; for example, an article
in Texas Monthly magazine suggested quail as the main
dish for a Texan Thanksgiving feast. John Madden, who
appeared on television for the NFL Thanksgiving Day
game from 1981 to 2001, frequently advocated his fondness for the turducken, deboned turkey, duck and chicken
nested inside each other then cooked.* [7] In a few areas
of the West Coast of the United States, Dungeness crab is
common as an alternate main dish, as crab season starts
in early November. Similarly, Thanksgiving falls within
deer hunting season in the Northeastern United States,
which encourages the use of venison as a centerpiece.
Sometimes a variant recipe for cooking turkey is used;

A Thanksgiving meal in New England

Many oﬀerings are typically served alongside the main
dish̶so many that, because of the amount of food, the
Thanksgiving meal is sometimes served midday or early
afternoon to make time for all the eating, and preparation
may begin at dawn or on days prior. Copious leftovers
are also common following the meal proper.
Traditional Thanksgiving foods are sometimes speciﬁc
to the day, and although some of the foods might be
seen at any semi-formal meal in the United States, the

286
meal often has something of a ritual or traditional quality. Many Americans would say it is “incomplete”
without cranberry sauce; stuﬃng or dressing; and gravy.
Other commonly served dishes include winter squash;
sweet potatoes; mashed potatoes; dumplings; noodles;
corn on the cob or hominy; deviled eggs; green beans
or green bean casserole; sauerkraut (among those in the
Mid-Atlantic; especially Baltimore); peas and carrots;
bread rolls; cornbread (in the south and parts of New
England); or biscuits, rutabagas or turnips; and a salad.
For dessert, various pies are often served, particularly
apple pie, mincemeat pie, sweet potato pie, pumpkin pie,
chocolate cream pie and pecan pie.
There are also regional diﬀerences as to the stuﬃng or
dressing traditionally served with the turkey. Southerners
generally make their dressing from cornbread, while those
in other parts of the country make stuﬃng from white,
wheat or rye bread as the base. One or several of the
following may be added to the dressing/stuﬃng: oysters,
apples, chestnuts, raisins, celery and/or other vegetables,
sausages or the turkey's giblets. The traditional Canadian
version has bread cubes, sage, onion and celery. Rice is
also sometimes used instead of bread in some parts of
Canada.

ble and their tastes. Spirits or cocktails sometimes may
be served before the main meal. On the dinner table, unfermented apple cider (still or sparkling) and/or wine are
often served. Pitchers of sweet tea can often be found on
Southern tables. Beaujolais nouveau is sometimes served,
as“Beaujolais day”
falls before American Thanksgiving.

A dessert is a typically sweet course that concludes a

There are a wide variety of desserts in western cultures,

Cake is a form of bread or bread-like food. In its modern
forms, it is typically a sweet baked dessert. In its oldest
forms, cakes were normally fried breads or cheesecakes,
and normally had a disk shape. Modern cake, especially
layer cakes, normally contain a combination of ﬂour,
sugar, eggs, and butter or oil, with some varieties also
requiring liquid (typically milk or water) and leavening
agents (such as yeast or baking powder).

List of American desserts
• U

This is a list of American desserts. The cuisine of the
United States refers to food preparation originating from
the United States of America. European colonization of
the Americas yielded the introduction of a number of ingredients and cooking styles to the latter. The various
styles continued expanding well into the 19th and 20th
centuries, proportional to the inﬂux of immigrants from
many foreign nations; such inﬂux developed a rich diversity in food preparation throughout the country.

The term 'café au lait' has been used for espresso and milk

75.10 Caﬀè crema
Caﬀè crema (Italian: cream coﬀee) refers to two diﬀerent
coﬀee drinks:* [2]
• An old name for espresso (1940s and 50s).
• A long espresso drink primarily served in Switzerland and Austria and northern Italy (1980s onwards), along the Italian/ Swiss and Italian/ Austrian
border.* [3]
As a colorful term it generally means

75.9 Café Cubano
Café Cubano (Cuban coﬀee, Cuban espresso, cafecito,
Cuban pull, Cuban shot) is a type of espresso which originated in Cuba after espresso machines were ﬁrst imported
there from Italy. Speciﬁcally, it refers to an espresso shot
which is sweetened with demerara sugar as it is being
brewed, but the name covers other drinks that use Cuban
espresso as their base. Drinking café cubano remains a
prominent social and cultural activity within Cuba, Miami, West Palm Beach, Tampa and the Keys, as well as A caﬀè latte

A café miel has a shot of espresso, steamed milk,

75.16 Coﬀee milk
A coﬀee milk is a drink similar to chocolate milk; however, instead of chocolate syrup, coﬀee syrup is used. It
is the oﬃcial state drink of Rhode Island in the United
States.

75.19 Cafe Zorro
A Cafe Zorro is a double espresso, or doppio, added to
hot water with a 1:1 ratio.* [6]

75.20 Ca phe sua da

75.17 Café mocha

A Cà phê sữa đá

A mocha latte in Costa Rica

A café mocha is a variant of a caﬀè latte. Like a latte, it is
typically one third espresso and two thirds steamed milk,
but a portion of chocolate is added, typically in the form
of a chocolate syrup, although other vending systems use
instant chocolate powder. Mochas can contain dark or
milk chocolate.
The term moccaccino is used in some regions of Europe
and the Middle East to describe caﬀè latte with cocoa or

condensed milk and then pouring it over ice. A substitute made by many Vietnamese immigrants in the Southern U.S., particularly in Louisiana is a dark French roast,
often with chicory; otherwise an imported Vietnamesegrown and roasted coﬀee is used when it is available. The
coﬀee is traditionally brewed with a small metal Vietnamese drip ﬁlter into a cup containing the condensed
milk. The condensed milk and coﬀee are stirred together
and then poured over the ice. Ca phe sua nong (Viet-

ally added to complete the drink.
In Spain, there is a similar beverage called Café del
Tiempo ([Summer] Weather Coﬀee) or Café con Hielo
(Coﬀee with Ice). Similarly, Café Bombón can be
served with ice. The coﬀee is served in a small cup and
an empty small glass with ices cubes. Sugar or condensed
milk is added in the small cup while the coﬀee is still
hot, and then the coﬀee is poured in the small glass with
ices. When the coﬀee is cooled, the remaining ice is
removed with the help of a spoon.

75.21 Cappuccino

75.23 Cold brew
Cold brew, or cold-press, refers to the process of steeping coﬀee grounds in room temperature or cold water for
an extended period. It is also sometimes referred to as
Toddy coﬀee which is a trademarked cold brewing system. The cold brew process requires grinding. Coarseground beans are soaked in water for a prolonged period
of time, usually 12 hours or more. The water is normally
kept at room temperature, but chilled water can also be
used. The grounds must be ﬁltered out of the water after
they have been steeped using a paper coﬀee ﬁlter, a ﬁne
metal sieve, a French press or felt, in the case of the Toddy
system. The result is a coﬀee concentrate that is often diluted with water or milk, and can be served hot, over ice,
or blended with ice and other ingredients such as chocolate. Cold brewed coﬀee naturally seems sweeter due to
its lower acidity. It is around 65-70% less acidic than hot
drip coﬀee or espresso. Because the coﬀee beans in cold
brew coﬀee never come into contact with heated water,
the process of leaching ﬂavor from the beans produces
a chemical proﬁle diﬀerent from conventional brewing
methods.* [7]
Cold brew coﬀee is not to be confused with iced coffee, which can refer to coﬀee that is brewed hot and then
chilled by pouring over or adding ice.

Cappuccino

Cappuccino is a coﬀee-based drink prepared with
espresso, hot milk, and steamed milk foam. A cappuccino diﬀers from a caﬀè latte in that it is prepared with
much less steamed or textured milk than the caﬀè latte
with the total of espresso and milk/foam making up between approximately 150 and 180 millilitres (5 and 6 US
ﬂuid ounces). A cappuccino usually exceeds the height
of the cup, making the foam visible above the side of the
cup. A cappuccino is traditionally served in a porcelain
cup, which has far better heat retention characteristics
than glass or paper. The foam on top of the cappuccino
acts as an insulator and helps retain the heat of the liquid,
allowing it to stay hotter longer.

75.33 Frozen coﬀee drink

CHAPTER 75. LIST OF COFFEE BEVERAGES
Outside New Zealand, the milk is prepared in a manner
more similar to that of a caﬀè latte; the milk is stretched
and texturised but is poured freely rather than the froth
being held back with a spoon or knife. This results in a
thicker density of milk with more froth.

In Australia the drink more closely resembles a caﬀè latte

sold under various names.

75.34 Flat white

In the United Kingdom the drink has a similar strength to
the New Zealand version. It is made in a small cup (150160ml), contains two espresso (often ristretto) shots, and
is often ﬁnished with latte art. The skill needed in preparing ristretto shots and latte art means that it is viewed as
somewhat of a speciality product in the UK.* [11]

75.35 Galão
Galão is a hot drink from Portugal made of espresso and
foamed milk. In all similar to caﬀè latte or café au lait,
it comes in a tall glass with about one quarter coﬀee, 3
quarters foamed milk. When the proportion is 1:1 it is
called“meia de leite”
(Chinesa in Madeira) and it comes
in a Coﬀee cup.

The drink originated in Australia and New Zealand in the
late 1970s as alternative to the frothier cappuccino. It has
since spread to the UK, where it ﬁrst began to be served by
independent cafes in London like Department of Coﬀee
and Social Aﬀairs, and Speak Easy, where owners and
staﬀ are from New Zealand, bring the style of coﬀee into
the UK before being adopted by chains Costa Coﬀee and
Starbucks.* [11] It is rarely found in continental Europe
or the United States.

75.37 Greek frappé coﬀee
Greek frappé (Café frappé) (Greek: φραπές) is a foamcovered iced coﬀee drink made from spray-dried instant
coﬀee. It is very popular in Greece especially during
summer, but has now spread on to other countries. There
are numerous ways in which this coﬀee can be tailored to
the individual's taste such as: 1.all water-no milk; 2.halfhalf; 3.all milk and; 4.varying levels of sweetness. Frappe
is also extremely popular in the country of Cyprus where
fresh milk is used as opposed to condensed. In French,
when describing a drink, the word frappé means shaken
and/or chilled; however, in popular Greek culture, the
word frappé is predominantly taken to refer to the shaking
associated with the preparation of a café frappé.

In New Zealand it is traditionally made with two shots of
espresso topped with stretched and texturised milk. The
milk is prepared by steaming air into the milk and folding
the top layer into the lower layers. To achieve the “ﬂat”
, non-frothy texture the steamed milk is poured from the
bottom of the jug, holding back the lighter froth on the
top in order to access milk with smaller bubbles, making
the drink smooth and velvety in texture. This leads to a
white coﬀee with the crema on top still intact. The drink
was traditionally served in a ceramic cup used for cappuccinos (approximately 220-260ml in capacity), though
present-day speciality cafes are more likely to serve it in 75.38 Green eye

Instant coﬀee is a beverage derived from brewed coﬀee

These can be rehydrated with hot water to provide a drink
similar (though not identical) to conventional coﬀee. At
least one brand of instant coﬀee is also available in concentrated liquid form.

been used to refer to coﬀee coming from those regions.

South Indian Coﬀee, also known as Mysore Filter Coffee or Kaapi (South Indian phonetic rendering of “coffee') is a sweet milky coﬀee made from dark roasted coffee beans (70%–80%) and chicory (20%–30%), especially popular in the southern states of Andhra Pradesh,

help the cream ﬂoat.

75.46 Latte macchiato
Latte macchiato literally means stained milk. This refers
to the method of preparation, wherein the milk gets
“stained”by the addition of espresso. It diﬀers significantly from caﬀè latte ﬁrstly in that espresso is added to
milk (rather than milk to espresso), secondly that it features more foam, rather than simply hot milk, thirdly in
that often only ½ (or less) of an espresso shot is used, and
fourthly in that it is often a “layered”drink, rather than
being mixed as in a caﬀè latte. Simply, in a caﬀè latte,
the emphasis is on the coﬀee, while in a latte macchiato,
the emphasis is on the milk.

75.48 Macchiato

Bailey's Irish Cream and coﬀee

A liqueur coﬀee, as its name suggests, is a coﬀee brew
with a 25 ml shot of liqueur. This brew is usually served
in a clear, clean, pre-heated, liqueur coﬀee glass with
the coﬀee and cream separated for good visual and taste
eﬀect. The liqueur of choice is added ﬁrst with a teaspoon of raw cane sugar mixed in. The glass is then ﬁlled
to within an inch of the top with good, strong, fresh ﬁlter coﬀee. Fresh, chilled, additive free, slightly whipped

Caﬀè macchiato – Macchiato, meaning 'stained', is an
espresso with a dash of foamed milk. At ﬁrst sight it
resembles a small Cappuccino, but even if the ingredients are the same as those used for Cappuccino, a Macchiato has a much stronger and aromatic taste.The milk
is foamed directly into the espresso cup, which is then
put under the coﬀee outlet. The espresso is then drawn
into the cup. Cocoa is then sprinkled over the drink (optional).* [12] Often the process is reversed and milk foam
is ﬂoated on top of extracted coﬀee. A long Macchiato
will have two shots of espresso and a small amount of hot
water (as per long black). A short Macchiato will usually have one shot of coﬀee and less water (as per short
black).

75.52. MOKA

331

75.52 Moka
Moka coﬀee is coﬀee brewed with a moka pot, a stovetop coﬀee maker which produces coﬀee by passing hot
water pressurized by steam through ground coﬀee in a
lower pressure than an espresso maker. The ﬂavor of
moka pot coﬀee depends greatly on bean variety, roast
level, ﬁneness of grind, and the level of heat used. Due to
the higher than atmospheric pressure involved, the mixture of water and steam reaches temperatures well above
100 °C, causing a more eﬃcient extraction of caﬀeine
and ﬂavors from the grounds, and resulting in a stronger
brew than that obtained by drip brewing.

75.53 Palazzo

A Caﬀè macchiato

75.49 Mazagran
Mazagran (sometimes misspelled as Mazagrin) is a cold
coﬀee beverage that originated in Algeria. It is typically
served in a tall glass, and is made with coﬀee and ice.
Sometimes sugar, rum, lemon or water is added. Sometimes a fast version is achieved by pouring a previously
sweetened espresso in a cup with ice cubes and a slice of
lemon.

A Palazzo is an iced coﬀee variant, popular in Southern
California. It is two shots of espresso, chilled immediately after brewing and mixed with sweetened cream. A
Palazzo is typically made using a moka pot.

75.54 Pharisäer
A Pharisäer, meaning a Pharisee, is an alcoholic coﬀee
beverage that is popular in the Nordfriesland district of
Germany. It consists of a mug of black coﬀee, a double
shot of rum, and a topping of whipped cream. In 1981, a
court in Flensburg ruled that 2 centilitres (0.70 imp ﬂ oz;
0.68 US ﬂ oz) of rum were not suﬃcient for preparing a
genuine Pharisäer.* [13]

75.55 Pocillo
75.50 Mélange
Mélange is popular in Austria, Switzerland and the
Netherlands, and is traditionally similar to caﬀè latte and
cappuccino (and more a mix of the two), a large cup
with (today) espresso and steamed milk with some milk
foam. Mélange and cappuccino both have variations
with whipped cream atop the blend of milk and coﬀee.
Outside Vienna this is sometimes referred to as 'Wiener
Melange', although that name does not exist there. The
origin of Mèlange goes back to the 1700s as a Café drink
(you wouldn't call it that at home) in Austria.

75.51 Mocha
see Cafe mocha (above)

A shot or small portion of unsweetened coﬀee, now usually made either using an espresso machine or a moka pot,
but traditionally made using a cloth drip, usually served
in cups made for the purpose (called "tazitas de pocillo").
It is widely-drunk in Latin America, usually as an afternoon or after-dinner coﬀee. The deﬁning feature is the
size, usually half size to a quarter size of the usual ~8 US
ﬂuid ounces (240 ml) coﬀee cups. There are a number
of small-sized drinks that use tazitas de pocillo, including
sweetened (such as café cubano and café cortado), but
these are usually not called a pocillo; rather, the Spanish
diminutive suﬃx "-ito”is usually added to the name of
the drink wanted in a pocillo size cup. For example, a
pocillo-sized cortado is usually called a cortadito.

75.56 Red eye
A red eye is dripped coﬀee with a single shot of espresso.
This drink is also known as a “shot in the dark”.

75.57 Red tie
A traditional Thai iced tea, which is a spicy and sweet
mixture of chilled black tea, orange blossom water, star
anise, crushed tamarind, sugar and condensed milk or
cream, with a single shot of espresso.

75.58 Ristretto
Ristretto is traditionally a short shot of espresso made
with the normal amount of ground coﬀee but extracted
with about half the amount of water.* [14] Since ristrettos
are essentially the ﬁrst half of a full length extraction, the
faster-to-extract compounds predominate in a ristretto.
The opposite of a ristretto is a lungo, which is typically
double the shot volume. Ristretto means “limited”or
“restricted”in Italian whereas lungo means “long.”
Straight ristrettos̶shots that are traditionally drunk from
a demitasse and not diluted into a larger cup containing
milk or water̶could be described as bolder, fuller, with
more body and less bitterness. These characteristics are
usually attributed to espresso in general but are more pronounced in a ristretto. Diluted into a cup of water (to
make an Americano or long black) or milk (e.g. latte and
cappuccino), ristrettos are less bitter and exhibit a more
tamed “espresso”character.

75.59 Rüdesheimer kaﬀee
Rüdesheimer kaﬀee is an alcoholic coﬀee drink from
Rüdesheim in Germany invented in 1957 by Hans Karl
Adam. It is made with Asbach Uralt brandy with coﬀee
and sugar, and is topped with whipped cream.

75.60 Turkish coﬀee

CHAPTER 75. LIST OF COFFEE BEVERAGES
preparation. Preparation of Turkish coﬀee consists of
immersing the coﬀee grounds in water which is most of
the time hot but not boiling for long enough to dissolve
the ﬂavour some compounds. While prolonged boiling of
coﬀee gives it an unpleasant“cooked”
or“burnt”
taste,
very brief boiling does not, and bringing it to the boil
shows without guesswork that it has reached the appropriate temperature. In Turkey, four degrees of sweetness are
used. The Turkish terms and approximate amounts are as
follows: sade (plain; no sugar), az şekerli (little sugar; half
a level teaspoon of sugar), orta şekerli (medium sugar;
one level teaspoon), and çok şekerli (a lot of sugar; one
and a half or two level teaspoons). The coﬀee and the
desired amount of sugar are stirred until all coﬀee sinks
and the sugar is dissolved. Following this, the spoon is
removed and the pot is put on moderate heat; if too high,
the coﬀee comes to the boil too quickly, without time to
extract the ﬂavour. No stirring is done beyond this point,
as it would dissolve the foam. Just as the coﬀee comes
to the boil the pot is removed from the heat. It is usually
kept oﬀ the heat for a short time, then brought to the boil
a second and a third time, then the coﬀee is poured into
the cups. Getting the thickest possible layer of foam is
considered the peak of the coﬀee maker's art. One way
to maximize this is to pour slowly and try to lift the pot
higher and higher as the pouring continues. Regardless of
these techniques, getting the same amount of foam into
all cups is hard to achieve, and the cup with the most foam
is considered the best of the lot.
Slight variations to this coﬀee exist in neighboring countries most notably: Greek coﬀee and Cypriot coﬀee.

75.61 Vienna coﬀee
A Vienna coﬀee is the name of a popular traditional
cream based coﬀee beverage. It is made by preparing
two shots of espresso in a standard sized coﬀee cup and
infusing the coﬀee with whipped cream (as a replacement
for milk and sugar) until the cup is full. Then the cream
is twirled and optionally topped oﬀ with chocolate sprinklings. The coﬀee is drunk through the cream top.

75.62 White coﬀee
Ipoh white coﬀee is a popular coﬀee drink which originated in Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia. The coﬀee beans are
roasted with palm-oil margarine, and the resulting coﬀee

Outline of wine
77.1 What is wine?
• Wine – alcoholic beverage typically made of
fermented grape juice.* [1] The natural chemical
balance of grapes is such that they can ferment
without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes or
other nutrients.* [2] Wine is produced by fermenting
crushed grapes using various types of yeast. Yeast
consumes the sugars found in the grapes and converts them into alcohol. Diﬀerent varieties of grapes
and strains of yeasts are used depending on the type
of wine being produced.

77.1.1 What type of thing is wine?
• Drink – liquid which is speciﬁcally prepared for human consumption. In addition to fulﬁlling a basic
need, drinks form part of the culture of human society.
• Alcoholic beverage – a beverage containing alcohol.

77.1.2 What is wine made of?
Wine includes the following ingredients:
• Ethanol – the type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages. It is a volatile, ﬂammable, colorless liquid.
It is also a psychoactive drug and one of the oldest
recreational drugs.
• Fermented grape juice – what wine is made from
A glass of white wine and another of red wine.
See also: Glossary of wine terms
The following outline is provided as an overview of and
topical guide to wine:

• Fermentation – catalyst function that turns
grape juice into an alcoholic beverage. During fermentation yeast interact with sugars in
the juice to create ethanol, commonly known
as ethyl alcohol.
• Grape – non-climacteric fruit that grows on the
perennial and deciduous woody vines of the
genus Vitis. Grapes can be eaten raw or used
for making jam, juice, jelly, vinegar, wine,
grape seed extracts, raisins, and grape seed oil.
